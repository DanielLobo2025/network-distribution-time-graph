The "Network-Distribution-Time-Visualizer" repository contains a Python script that utilizes the matplotlib library to create informative graphs illustrating the minimum distribution time for two network architectures: client-server (CS) and peer-to-peer (P2P). The code allows for easy comparison of distribution times as the number of clients varies, providing insights into network performance and scalability. This repository serves as a practical tool for network engineers and researchers to assess and visualize distribution time under different scenarios.
